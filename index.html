  <h1 class="title">The Three Pillars of Skill Development</h1>
  <p class="title__description">
    Skill development can be broken down into three primary categories: cognitive skills, technical skills, and interpersonal skills. Each plays an important role in shaping your overall competency and career success.

  <p class="cognitive__subttitle">
    Cognitive skills are the mental processes that help you learn, understand, and solve problems. These skills include logical reasoning, critical thinking, and the ability to analyze complex information. In a world where technology is constantly evolving, cognitive skills are essential for adapting to new challenges. For example, as a software engineer you might use cognitive skills to troubleshoot code or develop innovative solutions to problems. These skills are crucial for long-term success because they enable you to navigate change and make informed decisions.

    Technical Skills 
  </h3>
  <p class="technical__subttitle">
    Technical skills refer to the hands-on abilities required to perform specific tasks in a particular field. Whether you’re working in web development, data science, or digital marketing, technical skills are the backbone of your professional expertise. That said, in today’s fast-paced industries, technical skills can quickly become outdated—which is why continuous skill development is essential. Upskilling in areas such as advanced programming, data analytics, or user experience design can keep you relevant and competitive in your field.

  <p class="interpersonal__subtitle">
    While technical skills are important, interpersonal skills are what allow you to thrive in a collaborative work environment. These skills include communication, teamwork, and emotional intelligence. In a world where remote work and cross-functional teams are becoming the norm, having strong interpersonal skills can set you apart. We emphasize the development of these soft skills in addition to technical training, making our grads well-rounded professionals capable of crushing it in any workplace.
